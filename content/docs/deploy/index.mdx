## Authentication Provider

Ziit currently supports these two OAuth providers next to normal email and password accounts. You dont have to use either of them Ziit works just fine with email and password only auth.

  <Card

    href="https://auth.epilogue.team/dashboard/"

    Open Epilogue Auth Settings
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Epilogue OAuth" 
    href="https://auth.epilogue.team/dashboard/"
  >
    Open Epilogue Auth Settings

After getting your credentials from either of the two OAuth providers you can continue to setup the docker compose file.
