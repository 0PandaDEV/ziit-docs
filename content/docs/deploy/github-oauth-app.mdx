To enable GitHub authentication for Ziit, you need to create a GitHub OAuth App:

1. **Go to GitHub Developer Settings:**
   Navigate to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click on "New OAuth App"

2. **Register Your OAuth App:**

   - Application name: Ziit (or your preferred name)
   - Homepage URL: Your Ziit instance URL (e.g., https://ziit.example.com)
   - Authorization callback URL: Your callback URL (e.g., https://ziit.example.com/api/auth/github/callback)

3. **Get Your Credentials:**
   After registration, you'll receive a Client ID and can generate a Client Secret
   - Save these values for your Ziit configuration
   - Note: Keep your Client Secret secure and never expose it publicly
