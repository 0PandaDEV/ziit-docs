### Step 2: Register Your OAuth App

Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Application name | Ziit (or your preferred name) |
| Homepage URL | Your Ziit instance URL (e.g., https://ziit.example.com) |
| Authorization callback URL | Your callback URL (e.g., https://ziit.example.com/api/auth/github/callback) |

<Callout type="info" title="Callback URL Format">
  Make sure your callback URL matches exactly with your Ziit instance domain, followed by `/api/auth/github/callback`
</Callout>

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials

After registration, you'll receive a Client ID and can generate a Client Secret:

- Save these values for your Ziit configuration
- **Important**: Keep your Client Secret secure and never expose it publicly
