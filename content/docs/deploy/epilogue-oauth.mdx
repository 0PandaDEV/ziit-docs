To enable Epilogue authentication for Ziit, you need to create a Epilogue OAuth App.

<Steps>

## Go to the Application Settins

Navigate to [Epilogue Auth Settings](https://auth.epilogue.team/dashboard/) go to "Applications" and click on "New Application"

</Step>
<Step>
## Register Your OAuth App

Fill in the required fields:

| Field                      | Value                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name           | Ziit (or your preferred name)                                               |
| Authorization callback URL | Your callback URL (e.g., https://ziit.example.com/api/auth/github/callback) |
| Permissions | Select View Email, View Username and View ID |

<Callout type="warn" title="Permissions">
  The Permissions have to be set exactly like documented here otherwise auth will fail and throw an error. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Callback URL Format">
  Make sure your callback URL matches exactly with your Ziit instance domain, followed by `/api/auth/github/callback`.
</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
## Get Your Credentials

After registration, you'll receive a Application ID and Application Secret:

- Save these values for your Ziit configuration
- **Important**: Keep your Client Secret secure and never expose it publicly
